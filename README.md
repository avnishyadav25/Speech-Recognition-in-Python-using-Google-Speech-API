# Speech-Recognition-in-Python-using-Google-Speech-API

Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This project aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the SpeechRecognition library of Python. This is useful as it can be used on microcontrollers such as Raspberri Pis with the help of an external microphone.

Python Speech Recognition module:
```
 sudo pip install SpeechRecognition
